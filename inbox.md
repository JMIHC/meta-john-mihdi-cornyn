- Here you can write disorganised notes to be categorised later
- Bullet points are useful, but it could be free form text as well
- Sometimes it's better to just get things off your mind quickly, rather than stop to think where it belongs
- But don't let this list get too long
- Move information to more specific documents and link to them.
  - This helps you navigate between documents quickly
  - For example, you can `Cmd`+`Click` this: [[todo]]
- Some notes don't end up making sense the next day
- That's ok, you can just delete them!
  - You can always find them in your git history, if you really need it!

# Developing Dice roller app with Pusher and Netlify Functions
- Already set up new gatsby/tailwind/typescript project called roller.
- Created an adjacent folder called authenticator to hold the express app.
- Found an example of a Netlify function that acts as authenticator for Pusher channel using express inside of a lambda function.
- Created git repo for Dice project.
## Questions
- How do I get Netlify to both deploy roller and use authenticator as a function to call against?
- How do I get authenticator to use the right environmental variables?
- What do I need to do to translate these class components in the pusher tutorial to hooks?
- How do I test the pieces of this app?
